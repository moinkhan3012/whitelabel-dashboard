2. Easy to set up home network: Screw in the socket adapter, power on the light bulb camera, and the mobile application will guide you through the installation process.

This feature is particularly useful in scenarios where you want the camera to actively monitor a specific area or follow a person's movement.
Local SD Card Storage or Cloud Storage
Local SD card storage involves inserting a microSD card directly into the wifi light bulb camera to store the recorded video footage. The camera saves the recordings onto the SD card, which can then be removed and accessed using a compatible device such as a computer or card reader. Local storage provides a convenient option for storing video footage locally without relying on an internet connection or third-party services. However, it is important to note that the capacity of the SD card determines the amount of storage available, and there is a risk of losing the footage if the SD card gets damaged or lost.
Cloud storage refers to the practice of storing data on remote servers accessed via the internet. With cloud storage, the 5g light bulb camera sends the recorded video footage to a cloud service provider's servers. This allows you to access and manage your recordings remotely from various devices, such as smartphones, tablets, or computers, using a dedicated app or web interface. Cloud storage offers the advantage of off-site storage, ensuring that your recordings are securely saved even if the camera or local storage device is damaged or stolen. However, it may involve subscription fees or storage limitations depending on the service you want.

EDSACE security camera Light Bulb Camera
A light bulb camera is a type of security camera that is built into a light bulb. It serves a dual purpose by providing both illumination and surveillance capabilities. These cameras are typically designed to be easily installed in standard light bulb sockets, allowing them to blend seamlessly into the environment. Light bulb cameras are often equipped with features such as motion detection, live streaming, and remote access, enabling users to monitor their surroundings from a smartphone or computer. They can be a discreet and convenient option for home or office security.
A 5G dual-band wireless light bulb camera
A 5G dual-band wireless light bulb camera refers to a light bulb camera that supports both 2.4GHz and 5GHz frequency bands for wireless communication. This dual-band capability allows the camera to connect to a Wi-Fi network using either frequency, depending on the available options.
The advantage of having dual-band support is that it provides flexibility in terms of choosing the most suitable frequency band for your specific environment. The 2.4GHz band has a longer range and better wall penetration, making it suitable for larger areas or locations with obstacles. On the other hand, the 5GHz band offers faster data transfer speeds and is less prone to interference, making it ideal for high-bandwidth activities such as streaming video.
By having a 5G dual-band wireless light bulb camera, you can take advantage of both frequency bands to ensure a stable and reliable connection, which is crucial for the smooth functioning of the camera's surveillance and monitoring features.
Two-way audio light bulb camera
Two-way audio refers to a feature commonly found in light bulb cameras and other security devices that enables communication between the camera and a connected device, such as a smartphone or tablet. With two-way audio, you can both listen to and speak through the camera. This feature allows you to have real-time conversations or interactions with people near the camera. For example, if you're using the light bulb camera as a video doorbell, you can speak to visitors at your front door and hear their responses, even if you're not physically present at home. Similarly, you can use two-way audio to communicate with family members, pets, or even to deter potential intruders by speaking through the camera. Two-way audio enhances the functionality of light bulb cameras by providing an additional layer of security and convenience. It allows you to monitor and communicate with your surroundings remotely, making it a valuable feature for home or office surveillance systems.
Motion detection and auto tracking light bulb camera
Motion detection and auto tracking are two advanced features commonly found in light bulb cameras and other surveillance devices.
Motion detection enables the camera to detect movement within its field of view. When motion is detected, the camera can send notifications or trigger recording, alerting you to potential activity in the monitored area. This feature is useful for security purposes, as it allows you to be notified of any unexpected movement or intrusions.
Auto tracking takes motion detection a step further by automatically following the detected motion. When the camera detects movement, it can pan, tilt to keep the moving object or person within its frame. This feature is especially beneficial for tracking subjects that are in motion, such as a person walking across a room or a moving vehicle. By automatically tracking the motion, the camera can provide a clear and continuous view of the subject, ensuring that no important details are missed.
Both motion detection and auto tracking contribute to the effectiveness of light bulb cameras as surveillance tools. They enhance the camera's ability to capture relevant events, provide real-time alerts, and ensure comprehensive monitoring of the designated area.
Full color night vision light bulb camera
Full color night vision is an advanced feature available in some light bulb cameras and other surveillance devices. Traditional night vision technology uses infrared (IR) LEDs to illuminate the scene and capture images in black and white or grayscale. However, full color night vision employs additional technology to provide color images even in low-light or dark environments.
Typically, full color night vision utilizes low-light image sensors and advanced image processing algorithms to capture and enhance the available ambient light. This allows the camera to produce color images with improved clarity and detail during nighttime or low-light conditions. By retaining color information, it can provide more accurate and realistic representations of the scene, helping to identify objects and individuals more easily.
Full color night vision can be particularly beneficial in scenarios where color identification is crucial, such as identifying the color of a vehicle or distinguishing between different objects. It enhances the overall surveillance capability of light bulb cameras by providing a more comprehensive and detailed view, even in challenging lighting conditions.
Widely used in various occasions
Light bulb cameras have gained popularity and are being widely used in various occasions for their discreet nature and dual functionality. Here are a few examples of occasions where light bulb cameras are commonly employed:
1. Home Security: Light bulb cameras are commonly used for home security purposes. They can be installed in various areas of the house, such as entryways, hallways, or common areas, providing both illumination and surveillance capabilities.
2. Office or Workplace Monitoring: Light bulb cameras are suitable for monitoring office spaces, conference rooms, or shared areas in workplaces. They can help deter theft, monitor employee activities, and ensure the overall security of the premises.
3. Retail Stores: Light bulb cameras are often utilized in retail stores for surveillance and loss prevention purposes. They can be discreetly placed in the store's ceiling or light fixtures, allowing for effective monitoring of customer behavior and preventing theft.
4. Hospitality Industry: Light bulb cameras are used in hotels, guesthouses, and vacation rentals to enhance security for guests. They can be installed in common areas, corridors, or entrances to monitor for any unusual activity or unauthorized access.
5. Event Venues: Light bulb cameras can be temporarily installed in event venues or function halls to monitor crowds, entrances, or exits during events, concerts, or conferences.
The versatile nature of light bulb cameras makes them suitable for a wide range of occasions where discreet surveillance and illumination are desired. Their integration into everyday objects allows for inconspicuous monitoring without compromising functionality or aesthetics. Product information
